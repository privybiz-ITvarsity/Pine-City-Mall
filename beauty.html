<p>An enchantress disguised as an old beggar woman arrives at a castle during a ball and offers the host, a cruel and selfish prince, a rose in return for shelter from a storm. 
When he refuses, she reveals her identity. As punishment for the prince's lack of compassion, the enchantress transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects before then erasing the castle, himself, and his servants from the memories of their loved ones and everyone else in the town. 
She casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince that if he can learn to love another and be loved in return before the last petal falls, the spell will be broken. Otherwise, he will be doomed to remain a beast for the remainder of his days.</p>
