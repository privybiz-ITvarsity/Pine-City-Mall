<p>Minions is a 2015 American computer-animated comedy film produced by Illumination Entertainment and distributed by Universal Pictures. It is the spin-off prequel and the third installment overall in the Despicable Me franchise. 
Directed by Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda, written by Brian Lynch, and produced by Chris Meledandri and Janet Healy, the film stars the voices of Coffin as the Minions (including Kevin, Stuart, and Bob), Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm, Michael Keaton, Allison Janney, Steve Coogan, Jennifer Saunders, and is narrated by Geoffrey Rush.</p>
<p>Minions are small, yellow creatures who have existed since the beginning of time, evolving from yellow single-celled organisms into beings which exist only to serve history's most evil masters. 
After rolling a Tyrannosaurus into a volcano, getting their caveman leader eaten by a bear, crushing a Pharaoh under a pyramid after constructing it upside-down, exposing Count Dracula to sunlight, and accidentally firing a cannon at Napoleon while in Russia, the Minions are driven into isolation and start a new life in a massive cave. 
After many years, the Minions become depressed and unmotivated without a master to serve. To regain their dignity and sense of purpose, Kevin recruits Stuart and Bob, setting out to look for a new master.</p>
